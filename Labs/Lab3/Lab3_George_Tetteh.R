# Welcome to lab number 3. Today we'll be learning a few more 
# R/general programming concepts before moving onto lecture examples

########################################
####    Boolean logic, continued    ####
########################################

# the main logic operators in R are as follows:
# the NOT operator, !, turns TRUE into FALSE and vice versa
!TRUE
!FALSE
# the AND operator, &, returns TRUE only if elements on both sides of the operator are TRUE
1==1 & 2==1
# the inclusive OR operator, |, returns TRUE if EITHER of the elements are TRUE
1==1 | 2==1

# there is no operator for exclusive OR, but there is a function, xor()
xor(1==1 , 2==2)

# 1.1 
# mtcars is a database of cars with several variables such as horsepower, weight, number of cylinders etc.
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
# Using indexing (square brackets) and the & operator, write a line of code
# that selects only the rows of mtcars with at least 6 cylinders (mtcars$cyl >= 6) and horsepower of at least 110 (mtcars$hp >= 110). Remember to include all the columns.
mtcars[mtcars$cyl >= 6 & mtcars$hp >= 110, ]
### 1.2
# Now select only those rows with either high efficiency (miles per gallon (mpg) of at least 25) or low weight (wt <= 2.5)
mtcars[mtcars$mpg >= 25 | mtcars$wt <= 2.5, ][c(1,6)]
#############################
####    If statements    ####
#############################

# The if() function will execute everything after it, either on the same line or in {} brackets,
# only if there is a TRUE boolean statement within the parentheses
x <- 5
if(x > 3) print ('This statement is true')
if(x-4==1){
  new_object <- c('this','statement','is','also','true')
  print(new_object)
}

### 2.1
# Write a function called probe, that takes two arguments, n and w.
# The function should return a character vector of length n, consisting of 'Water' and 'Land', sampled with probability w. (so probability of sampling 'Water' is w)
# If the p argument is not numeric, or if it is not between 0 and 1, the function should return the following message:
# "Please input a probability between 0 and 1"
probe <- function(n, w) {
  if (!is.numeric(w) || w < 0 || w > 1) {
    return("Please input a probability between 0 and 1")
  }
  result <- sample(c("Water", "Land"), size = n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(w, 1 - w))
  return(result)
}

# After the if statement we can put an else statement:
if(x-4>1){
  new_object <- c('this','statement','is','also','true')
  print(new_object)
}else{
  print('This is untrue')
}

# A simplified version of if()else is the following:
ifelse(x/2==7,print('Definitely true'),print('categorically false'))

##################################
####    Paste and strsplit    ####
##################################

# paste() and strsplit() can be used to join and separate
# character objects (strings), respectively. For example:

paste('Hello','world!', sep='_')
strsplit('Hello to you too. /My name is Ed.', split='/')

# You'll notice that strsplit returns a list. This allows us to vectorise the function:
strsplit(rownames(mtcars),split=' ')


#####################
####    Loops    ####
#####################

# Loops are algorithms that repeat a procedure over and over until they are instructed to stop.
# There are two main kinds:
# FOR loops iterate over a predetermined set (vector, list, etc)
fruits <- c('apple','banana', 'pineapple','mango','orange')
for(i in fruits){
  print(paste('My favourite fruit is',i,sep=': '))
}

useless_function <- function(n){
  for (i in 1:n){
    print(paste0(i,'. This number is: ', c('even','odd')[i%%2 +1]))
  }
}
useless_function(7)

### 4.1 
data(iris)

# Write a for loop that iterates over the column names of the iris dataset and print each together with the number of characters in the column name in parenthesis. Example output: Sepal.Length (12). To get the number of characters use the function nchar().
for (col in colnames(iris)) {
  cat(col, "(", nchar(col), ")\n")
}


# Next, WHILE loops continue to loop until the boolean statment in the defining parentheses, e.g.
x <- 0
while(x<100){
  print(x)
  x <- x+sample(1:20,1)
}

### 4.2 How many numbers do you need in the sequence 1*2*3*4*5*... before the product exceeds 10 million?
# Use a while loop to get the answer
product <- 1
count <- 0

while (product*count < 10000000) {
  count <- count + 1
    product <- product * count
}

cat("The number of terms required beofore exceeding 10 million is:", count)

###################################
####    Linear models intro    ####
###################################

# We can run an OLS linear model using lm()
# Inside the lm and other model functions we use formulas
# Formulas have the dependent variable on the left and the independent (predictor) variables on the right with a ~ in between
# Lets run a bivariate regression of car weight (in 1000 pounds/500 kg) on miles per gallon (1mpg = 1km/L)
model <- lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt)
summary(model)
### 5.1
# What does the Estimate for the (Intercept) number represent?
# The intercept number shows the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero
# Thus a car with a weight of zero would have an average mpg of 37.2851. However, this interpretation is
# not practically meaningful as it is impossible for a car to have zero weight.
### 5.2
# What does the Estimate for the mtcars$wt number represent?
# It means  means that for every one unit increase in weight (mtcars$wt), the mpg (mtcars$mpg) decreases
# by an average of 5.3445 units, holding other variables constant.

### 5.3 
# Is the relationship between these two variables positive or negative? Why do you think that might be?
# This is because the estimated slope coefficient for mtcars$wt is negative (-5.3445), 
# indicating that as the weight of a car increases, its miles per gallon (mpg) decreases.
# Thus, a heavier car may require a powerful engine , hence more energy to move

### 5.4 What is the predicted average efficiency in miles per gallon of a 4000 pound (2000kg) car?
wt <- 4000/1000

a=-5.3445
b= 37.2851
x=4
y=a*x+b
y

# Let's transform the independent variable:
mtcars$wt_centred <- mtcars$wt - mean(mtcars$wt)
mtcars$wt_centred
### 5.5
# compare the mean and variance of the new variable with the untransformed variable. What do you notice?
# Compute the mean and variance of wt
wt_mean <- mean(mtcars$wt)
wt_var <- var(mtcars$wt)

# Compute the mean and variance of wt_centred
wt_centred_mean <- mean(mtcars$wt_centred)
wt_centred_var <- var(mtcars$wt_centred)
wt_centred_mean
# Print the results
cat("Original wt - Mean:", wt_mean, "Variance:", wt_var, "\n")
cat("Centred wt - Mean:", wt_centred_mean, "Variance:", wt_centred_var)
#The mean is almost zero but the varience is the same. The shit of mean to zero 
# does not change spread of the data

### 5.6
# Run a new regression with new independent variable
# What do you notice about the estimates?
# What is the interpretation of the (Intercept) estimate in this regression?
model <- lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt_centred)
summary(model)
#The intercept is estimated to be 20.09, which represents the predicted
#value of mpg when wt_centred is zero. The slope coefficient of wt_centred 
#is estimated to be -6.03, which indicates the average change in mpg 
#associated with a one-unit increase in wt_centred. 
### 5.7
# Run the following code:
y <- mtcars$mpg
x <- cbind(1,mtcars$wt)

# A couple of functions for you to know:
# t() returns the transpose of any matrix
# solve() returns the inverse of any (invertible) matrix
# %*% is matrix multiplication
# with that in mind try to code the following expression in R:
#(x'x)^(-1) * (x'y)
# where ' means the transpose
# Run the code you have written. What do you find?

solve(t(x) %*% x) %*% t(x) %*% y
