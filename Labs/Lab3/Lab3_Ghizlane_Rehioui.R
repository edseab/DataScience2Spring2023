# Welcome to lab number 3. Today we'll be learning a few more 
# R/general programming concepts before moving onto lecture examples

########################################
####    Boolean logic, continued    ####
########################################

# the main logic operators in R are as follows:
# the NOT operator, !, turns TRUE into FALSE and vice versa
!TRUE
!FALSE
# the AND operator, &, returns TRUE only if elements on both sides of the operator are TRUE
1==1 & 2==1
# the inclusive OR operator, |, returns TRUE if EITHER of the elements are TRUE
1==1 | 2==1

# there is no operator for exclusive OR, but there is a function, xor()
xor(1==1 , 2==2)

# 1.1 
# mtcars is a database of cars with several variables such as horsepower, weight, number of cylinders etc.
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
# Using indexing (square brackets) and the & operator, write a line of code
# that selects only the rows of mtcars with at least 6 cylinders (mtcars$cyl >= 6) and horsepower of at least 110 (mtcars$hp >= 110). Remember to include all the columns.
df <- mtcars %>% filter(cyl >= 6 & hp >= 110)
### 1.2
# Now select only those rows with either high efficiency (miles per gallon (mpg) of at least 25) or low weight (wt <= 2.5)
df <- df %>% filter(mpg >= 25 | wt <= 2.5)

#############################
####    If statements    ####
#############################

# The if() function will execute everything after it, either on the same line or in {} brackets,
# only if there is a TRUE boolean statement within the parentheses
x <- 5
if(x > 3) print ('This statement is true')
if(x-4==1){
  new_object <- c('this','statement','is','also','true')
  print(new_object)
}

### 2.1
# Write a function called probe, that takes two arguments, n and w.
# The function should return a character vector of length n, consisting of 'Water' and 'Land', sampled with probability w. (so probability of sampling 'Water' is w)
# If the p argument is not numeric, or if it is not between 0 and 1, the function should return the following message:
# "Please input a probability between 0 and 1"
probe <- function(n, w) {
  if (w<0 | w>1 | is.numeric(w)==FALSE){
    print("Please input a probability between 0 and 1!")
  }else{
    if (w == 1){
      n <- 'Water'
    }else if(w == 0){
      n <- 'Land'
    }else{
      print(paste0("The probability of Water is ", w, ' and the probability of Land is ', 1-w))
    }
    return(n)
    }
}
# case object is a mix
n <- 'Unknown Mix' # example of value of n
w <- 0.22 # example of value of w
type_w_l <- probe(n, w)
type_w_l
# case object is water
n <- 'Unknown Mix' # example of value of n
w <- 1 # example of value of w
type_w_l <- probe(n, w)
type_w_l
# case object is land
n <- 'Unknown Mix' # example of value of n
w <- 0 # example of value of w
type_w_l <- probe(n, w)
type_w_l
# case object is outside range 
n <- 'Unknown Mix' # example of value of n
w <- 2 # example of value of w
type_w_l <- probe(n, w)
type_w_l
# case object is not correct input
n <- 'Unknown Mix' # example of value of n
w <- 'incorrect input' # example of value of w
type_w_l <- probe(n, w)
type_w_l

# After the if statement we can put an else statement:
if(x-4>1){
  new_object <- c('this','statement','is','also','true')
  print(new_object)
}else{
  print('This is untrue')
}

# A simplified version of if()else is the following:
ifelse(x/2==7,print('Definitely true'),print('categorically false'))

##################################
####    Paste and strsplit    ####
##################################

# paste() and strsplit() can be used to join and separate
# character objects (strings), respectively. For example:

paste('Hello','world!', sep='_')
strsplit('Hello to you too. /My name is Ed.', split='/')

# You'll notice that strsplit returns a list. This allows us to vectorise the function:
strsplit(rownames(mtcars),split=' ')


#####################
####    Loops    ####
#####################

# Loops are algorithms that repeat a procedure over and over until they are instructed to stop.
# There are two main kinds:
# FOR loops iterate over a predetermined set (vector, list, etc)
fruits <- c('apple','banana', 'pineapple','mango','orange')
for(i in fruits){
  print(paste('My favourite fruit is',i,sep=': '))
}

useless_function <- function(n){
  for (i in 1:n){
    print(paste0(i,'. This number is: ', c('even','odd')[i%%2 +1]))
  }
}
useless_function(7)

### 4.1 
data(iris)

# Write a for loop that iterates over the column names of the iris dataset and print each together with the number of characters in the column name in parenthesis. Example output: Sepal.Length (12). To get the number of characters use the function nchar().
for (i in colnames(iris)) {
  print(paste0(i,' (', nchar(i), ')'))
}

# Next, WHILE loops continue to loop until the boolean statment in the defining parentheses, e.g.
x <- 0
while(x<100){
  print(x)
  x <- x+sample(1:20,1)
}

### 4.2 How many numbers do you need in the sequence 1*2*3*4*5*... before the product exceeds 10 million?
# Use a while loop to get the answer
target <- 10000000
i <- 0
seq_product <- 1
while(seq_product < target){ 
  i <- i + 1
  seq_product <- seq_product*i
}
if(seq_product > target) { 'this if statement is needed to make sure that the product has not exceeded the target value before breaking from the loop'
  seq_product <- seq_product/i
  i <- i-1
}
i
seq_product

###################################
####    Linear models intro    ####
###################################

# We can run an OLS linear model using lm()
# Inside the lm and other model functions we use formulas
# Formulas have the dependent variable on the left and the independent (predictor) variables on the right with a ~ in between
# Lets run a bivariate regression of car weight (in 1000 pounds/500 kg) on miles per gallon (1mpg = 1km/L)
model <- lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt)
summary(model)
### 5.1
# What does the Estimate for the (Intercept) number represent?
'The Estimate for the (Intercept) represents the value of a in the linear equation y = a + bx where x is wt and y is mpg'
### 5.2
# What does the Estimate for the mtcars$wt number represent?
'The Estimate for the (Intercept) represents the coefficient b of x in the linear equation y = a + bx where x is wt and y is mpg'

### 5.3 
# Is the relationship between these two variables positive or negative? Why do you think that might be?
'The  relationship between mgp and wt is negative because the coefficient of the linear equation b = -5.3445 is negative: an increase in the wt implies a dicrease in the mgp.'

### 5.4 What is the predicted average efficiency in miles per gallon of a 4000 pound (2000kg) car?
pred_avg_ef_2k <- 37.2851 - 5.3445*4000/1000 # because the units in the table of wt is divided by 1000 lbs
pred_avg_ef_2k 
'The predicted average efficiency of a a 4000 pound car is 15.9071 miles per gallon.'

# Let's transform the independent variable:
mtcars$wt_centred <- mtcars$wt - mean(mtcars$wt)

### 5.5
# compare the mean and variance of the new variable with the untransformed variable. What do you notice?
mean(mtcars$wt)
mean(mtcars$wt_centred)
'The mean of the transformed variable is very small (10^17 times smaller) compared to the mean of the untransformed varibale. The mean is affected by the transformation.'
var(mtcars$wt)
var(mtcars$wt_centred)
'The variance of the transformed variable is the same as the mean of the untransformed varibale. The variance is not affected by the transformation.'

### 5.6
# Run a new regression with new independent variable
# What do you notice about the estimates?
# What is the interpretation of the (Intercept) estimate in this regression?
model <- lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt_centred)
summary(model)
'We notice that the estimate of the intercept has changed but the estimate of the coefficient remains the same as before.

We interpret the estimate of the intercept as the starting value of the linear line of the regression: it is the starting value of mpg where wt_centered is 0 (i.e. where theoretically wt is 0 which is impossible in reality).'

### 5.7
# Run the following code:
y <- mtcars$mpg
x <- cbind(1,mtcars$wt)

# A couple of functions for you to know:
# t() returns the transpose of any matrix
# solve() returns the inverse of any (invertible) matrix
# %*% is matrix multiplication
# with that in mind try to code the following expression in R:
# (x'x)^(-1) * (x'y)
# where ' means the transpose
# Run the code you have written. What do you find?
solve((t(x) %*%x))  %*% (t(x) %*% y)
'The output is: 
          [,1]
[1,] 37.285126
[2,] -5.344472

This output is the same as the output of the linear regression model of mgp and the untransformed variable wt.'
